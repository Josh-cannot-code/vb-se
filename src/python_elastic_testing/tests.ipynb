       " ' Good morning, Hank. It\\'s Tuesday. I want to talk today about Boko Haram which\\nwas formed in Nigeria in 2002, but I want to begin in the year 1100-ish. So Hank, we have this idea that Islam spread\\nprimarily through conquest, but in fact, in many places, including Sub-Saharan Africa,\\nIslam spread primarily by trade. So back in the year 1100-ish, leaders in what\\nis now Northern Nigeria started to convert to Islam. They were trading with North African Berbers\\nand by the 18th century, most of the people in what is now Northern Nigeria and also what\\nis now Southwestern Nigeria were Muslims. But those Sub-Saharan African empires never\\nspread to the rest of Southern Nigeria so those people were not Muslims. Instead, in the 19th century, when a bunch\\nof European missionaries showed up, many of those people in the rest of Southern Nigeria\\nbecame Christians. What is now Nigeria was colonized by the British\\nfor much of the 20th century, but Northern Nigeria was controlled by what\\'s known as\\nindirect rule. Like the local emirs were allowed to run everything\\nas long as they pledged allegiance to the British and also, paid them a portion of their\\nmoney. Now, as far as colonization goes, that seems\\nlike a pretty good deal, but also meant there was much less western-style education in Northern\\nNigeria than in Southern Nigeria which was much more directly ruled by the British. So the south ended up with most of the doctors\\nand the lawyers and the bureaucrats. Also, all of the oil is in the south. I should pause here to say that this is of\\ncourse over simplifying. There are hundreds of languages spoken in\\nNigeria and hundreds of different ethnic groups. There are many Christians living in predominantly\\nMuslim communities; many Muslims living in predominantly Christian communities. So it\\'s definitely not as simple as a divide\\nbetween North and South, but there is a big gap there. Ok Hank, so one of the many catastrophes of\\ncolonization is that it created borders that were convenient to Europeans, but not necessarily\\nto the people who, like, lived in the actual places. So in 1960, Nigeria gains independence which\\nis awesome except it\\'s never actually been, like, a unified political entity. Hank, there\\'s this famous moment in James\\nJoyce\\'s novel, \"Ulysses\" where Leopold Bloom is asked what a nation is, and Bloom answers,\\n\"A nation is the same people living in the same place - or also living in different places.\" But 1960, Nigeria was more like different\\npeople living in the same place which led to a bunch of coups and then, eventually,\\nto a 1967 civil war. Parts of Southern Nigeria seceded and became\\nthe Republic of Biafra. And the rest of Nigeria was like, \"Wait, no. We should be one Nigeria. Also, all the oil is in your new country.\" There was a huge civil war for two and a half\\nyears. More than a million people died, but in the\\nend, Nigeria won, and the Republic of Biafra ceased to exist, and the country was reunited. So Nigeria today is a really interesting country. It\\'s split almost evenly between Christians\\nand Muslims. It has one of the fastest growing economies\\nin the world and very little national debt. It\\'s the largest economy in Africa and the\\n20th largest in the world. Their film industry generates 10 billion dollars\\nin sales a year. But it\\'s also the last nation in Africa that\\nstill has polio, which is found only in the north, and life expectancy in Nigeria is 52. That\\'s lower than it is in Somalia which doesn\\'t\\neven have a government. In much of Northern Nigeria, fewer than half\\nof kids even go to elementary school. Female literacy is over 50% and while the\\ncountry\\'s overall economy grows over 8% a year, in the north, absolute poverty is actually\\nincreasing. Hank, it\\'s easy enough to say that religion\\nis the problem here, right? Except there are a lot of Muslims living in\\nthe southwest of Nigeria where female literacy is over 90% and the economy is growing really\\nwell. The problem is partly resource allegation. Like, Nigeria\\'s export economy is just a smidge\\ndependent upon petroleum which is found almost exclusively in the south. But there\\'s also all these legacies of colonialism\\nand indirect rule which means less effective federal governance in everything from education\\nto the armed forces. So this was the Northern Nigeria that saw\\nBoko Haram emerge in 2002, a region disproportionately impoverished, uneducated, and poorly governed. The words Boko Haram literally mean \"western\\neducation is forbidden\". The group was founded by a guy named Mohammed\\nYusuf who himself had a western-style education and spoke English. Although he believed that the earth is flat\\nand that rain is not caused by evaporation, so maybe it wasn\\'t such a great education. In 2002, he began recruiting unemployed young\\npeople into his movement, railing against official corruption, which is rampant, and\\nalso advocating for the creation of Islamic state. But Boko Haram didn\\'t actually become a military\\norganization until Yusuf was arrested and then shortly thereafter, executed in 2009. Over a thousand people were killed in the\\nriots that followed Mohammed Yusuf\\'s execution, and after that, Boko Haram became increasingly\\nmilitant and crazy. I mean, this is an organization that claims\\nthey want to restore like righteousness and justice to Nigeria, but they fund themselves\\nlike primarily through drug trafficking and bank robbery. In 2011, Boko Haram was behind Nigeria\\'s first\\never suicide bombing. On Christmas of that year, they killed 41\\npeople via bombings and shootings in churches. In 2012, they killed at least 792 people. And in 2013, they murdered nine women who\\nwere distributing polio vaccines. Polio vaccines! They also murdered 54 mostly Muslim college\\nstudents while they were sleeping in their dorms. And then, in 2014, Boko Haram got worldwide\\nattention when they kidnapped 276 girls from inside of classrooms. The attacks since then have only gotten worse. On January 3rd of this year, they seized the\\ntown of Baga, burned it to the ground, murdered as many as 2000 people. And now, Boko Haram controls the northeastern\\ncorner of Nigeria where they\\'ve instituted a version of sharia law so extreme that not\\nonly has the likes of it never been seen in Sub-Saharan Africa, but it\\'s, like, too extreme\\nfor al-Qaeda. They regularly massacre people who won\\'t fight\\nfor them, and they\\'ve begun attacks in Niger and Chad and Cameroon. Boko Haram still has an army between 7,000-10,000\\npeople, and it\\'s difficult to understand what those people are thinking, at least what the\\nleaders are thinking. I mean, they conscript a lot of people; they\\nhave a lot of child soldiers; they force preteen girls to be suicide bombers. And it\\'s hard to understand that evil. Then again, I don\\'t know if I need to understand\\nit, but I do need to know about it. I mean, not knowing about this stuff is really\\nproblematic, Hank, because one of the great tragedies of Boko Haram is that they have\\nbeen allowed to grow for the last ten years because the Nigerian government and the world\\ncommunity haven\\'t done a good enough job of noticing how terrible they are. So I think it\\'s really important to learn\\nabout Boko Haram and not let their atrocities go unnoticed, but I also think it\\'s important\\nto understand that literally 99.9% of Nigerians do not support Boko Haram. And Hank, it\\'s also important to remember\\nthat just a few days ago, two Muslim volunteers in a northern town sacrificed their lives\\nto keep a Boko Haram suicide bomber from entering a city market where she would have killed\\nhundreds of people. Hank, I\\'ll see you on Friday.',\n",
